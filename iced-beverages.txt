"
Git rebase is a powerful Git command used to integrate changes from one branch into another. 
It is a way of combining multiple commits into a single, linear sequence of commits. 
Unlike git merge, which creates a new merge commit, git rebase rewrites the commit history."

How to switch branch:
git branch feature
git status        
	On branch main
	nothing to commit, working tree clean
git branch -a
	* main
git checkout feature 
	Switched to branch 'feature'
git branch -a       
	* feature
  	main
(you can create and checkout to the created branch by: git checkout -b nameOfTheFile)
